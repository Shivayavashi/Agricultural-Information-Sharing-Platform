# Agricultural-information-sharing-platform

Agricultural Information Sharing Platform (AISP) is a groundbreaking 
endeavor that harnesses the power of advanced AI technologies to revolutionize the 
way farmers interact with information. The platform is built using Llama-2-Chat 
(Large Language Model Meta AI), a pretrained and finetuned generative text model. 
The platform assists users with agricultural-related queries, providing information on 
crops, pest control, farming practices, and more. 

The platform is designed and developed with the Django framework with 
MongoDB database in the virtual machine (VM) with GPU support. The Llama-2
chat models of version 7b and 13b are downloaded from Meta AI that plays a critical 
role in generating contextually relevant responses for the userâ€™s queries and inquiries.

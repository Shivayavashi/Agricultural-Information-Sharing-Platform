TNAU assumed full responsibilities of  Agricultural Education and Research and supported the State Agricultural  Department by delivering research products. Till 1946, the Agricultural College  and Research Institute, Coimbatore, was the only Institute for Agricultural  Education for the whole of South India. In 1958, it was recognized as a  Post-graduate Centre leading to Masters and Doctoral degrees. The Agricultural  College & Research Institute, Madurai was established in 1965. These two  colleges formed the nucleus of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University while it  was established in 1971.   In 1972, separate degree programmes of B.Sc. (Horticulture) and B.E.(Agriculture)  were started. In 1979, a separate Faculty of Horticulture was established. In  1980, B.Sc.(Home Science) programme was started at Madurai campus. The third  Agricultural College was started at Killikulam in 1984 and the fourth at  Kumulur (Trichy) in 1989 and later shifted to Navalur Kuttappattu (Trichy) in  1992 which is named as Anbil Dharmalingam Agricultural College and Research  Institute.
